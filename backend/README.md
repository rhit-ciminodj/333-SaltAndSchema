# Backend Directory

This directory is reserved for backend data manipulation code.

## Structure

Add your backend implementation here:
- Database connection logic
- API endpoints
- Data models
- Business logic

## Important Note

All backend data manipulation must be your own work.
The frontend (React + Tailwind CSS) can leverage AI assistance,
but the backend logic should be implemented by you.
